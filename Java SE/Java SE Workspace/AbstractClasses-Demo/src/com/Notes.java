	 *  Abstract Classes
	 *  -> Abstract class is a method specification which contains zero or  more
	 *     abstract and concrete methods
	 *  -> Any class which extends abstract class, then that class must implement/
	 *     override all the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.
	 *  -> Any sub class of an abstract class is not implementing any one of the
	 *     abstract method from the super class, then that sub class must be defined
	 *     as 'abstract' 
	 * 
	 * 	-> We can not create an object to the abstract class.
	 * 	-> But we can create a reference object to the abstract class
